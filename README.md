# ML_Feature_Engineering
The project focused on using feature engineering, alongside supervised, ensemble, and unsupervised learning, to build a prediction model for identifying Pass/Fail yield in a semiconductor manufacturing process. By uncovering key factors affecting yield excursions, the model helps improve process efficiency, reduce learning time, and lower production costs per unit.
