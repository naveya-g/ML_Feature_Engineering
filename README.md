# ML_Feature_Engineering
The project focused on using feature engineering, alongside supervised, ensemble, and unsupervised learning, to build a prediction model for identifying Pass/Fail yield in a semiconductor manufacturing process. By uncovering key factors affecting yield excursions, the model helps improve process efficiency, reduce learning time, and lower production costs per unit.

The dataset contains 1567 datapoints with 591 features. 

Feature Engineering techniques such as Variation Inflation Factor, Mutual Information Gain, Low variance, PCA(Principal Component Analysis) were used to reduce the features from 591 to 21 most important features.

Model building was done using ML Pipelines.
